x - 'animalName' should be replaced by 'subject'
x - cellDB items don't have experimenter or paradigm?
x - If data doesn't exist loader.get_cluster_data() does not fail. Just gives empty data.
x - Regarding use of str() and expr(). Maybe the default expr() should be to print every attribute.
  and str() have a shorter summary
  for example for cellDB.Site
  Reason: I find site5.clusterList misleading (it doesn't tell me what type the items are)
x - CellDB should have an easy way to add a cluster (without creating all the other stuff).
x - cellDB.Cluster should have a way to create a cluster easily from basic info.
  Currently we need to create a site (add sessions and add clusters), and get clusterList to add it to CellDB.

x- Easy way to see the files corresponding to each cell of interest (to copy them easily from jarahub)
x - Why do we need to specify tetrodes when creating a site? (if we need to do it again when adding a cluster)
  is it because we want to be able to do run analysis per site? (like spike-sorting)
    This problem should be solved once we have a method for making clusters manually

x - Why the underscores in repr of cluster?
  This is just printing the cluster ID, which is a unique string for each cluster

x - The fact that we have a different "experimenter" for different data sets sometimes gets on the way. Let's discuss the possibility of getting rid of experimenter.
x - cluster.get_data_filenames with no arguments should return the list of all

Related to the dataloader
- loader did not work for test059 2015-06-26_15-46-23 T3c8. Different number of
  behav and ephys trials. but the older method worked fine.
- Not clear why dataloader.DataLoader() has param 'offline'

* loadopenephys.py
- The goal is to load raw data from a file (in raw format?)
- Should it have a way to add cluster data?
- Should it also convert numbers to the right units? (timestamps to seconds, divide gain, etc)

* ephyscore.py
- The goal is to load data easily given a cell from the database.
- It may make it inefficient to load several clusters/cells from the same tetrode.
  (since it requires reloading the tetrode spike data)
- It should associate to ephys events (sent from arduino) and to relevant behavioral data (stored by taskontrol).

* recordingday.py
- recordingday imports ephys_experiment_v3.EphysExperiment
  but when using them we also need to import both?
  Somethign seems recursive. They should be independent or hierarchical.
- Parameters laserPulseResponse,soundResponsive,followsTrain don't seem appropriate
  because they will probably change in the future (some added, some gone).
  Maybe we should have them in a dictionary of 'features'.

* ephys_experiment_v3.py
- This object should be independent of the server. Maybe we need to define better the role of this object.

= Minor:
- Name 'recordingday.Recording' may be misleading (there are many recordings per day), 
  but I can't come up with a better one.
